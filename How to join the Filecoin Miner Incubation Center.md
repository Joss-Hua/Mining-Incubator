# How to join the Filecoin Miner Incubation Center

## Process

#### 1. Application and Review

The Phase1 of Filecoin Miners Incubation Center will get started from 2021 / 07 / 26 to 2021 / 10 / 24, providing 15 places. Please fill in and submit the [Application Form](http://venusteam.mikecrm.com/1lmpQtj) from 07 / 12 to 07 / 19. The content of the application form should be detailed and true, so that it can be reviewed as soon as possible. It is worth noting that we will contact each miner who submitted the application form (through the contact information you provided) and feed back the results. Once the application is passed, your node will access the incubation center as soon as possible after 2021 / 07 / 25, and no need to wait for the final review results of the whole program. More details about the Filecoin Miner Incubation Center, see [here](./README.md).

#### 2. Deploy the independent modules

You need to deploy the independent moduler for your nodes. Check out [Video tutorial]() or [Text tutorial]().

#### 3. Deploy the shared modules
You need to connect your independent module to the shared module of the Venus Implementation related to the Miner Incubation Center. Check out [Video tutorial]() or [Text tutorial]().

## Need More help
The program used in the above process comes from the open source [venus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus/releases). 
Due to the different familiarity with the program or Venus Implementation, different miners may encounter a variety of problems in the process of deployment or access, such as modules, network, gateway, parameters, commands, hardware, etc.
